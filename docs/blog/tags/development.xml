<p>So I have been meaning to write a blog for sometime, and I have been programming with PHP, Javascript coming up to 2 years. So I've been looking at learning a new language, and always wondered what it would be like to learn Golang.</p>

<p><img src="https://bladedevleoper.github.io/grow-as-a-developer.io/assets/images/go-gopher.jpg" height="239" width="580" title="Go gopher" alt="image of the Go Gopher"></p>

<h1 id="what-is-golang%3F">What Is Golang?</h1>

<p>Go or as others would say Golang, is a an open source programming language that allows to build reliable and efficient software. Go was created by a team of developers at Google. They are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griesemer">Robert Griesemer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike">Rob Pike</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>. Golang is a staticically and a strongly typed language</p>

<h1 id="what-can-golang-be-used-for%3F">What can Golang be used for?</h1>

<p>Golang can be used in many different ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Build Web Applications
    </li>
    <li>
        CLI Applications
    </li>
    <li>
        Automate tasks on the server
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Like Python and PHP, Go too is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language">general purpose language</a> which means it can be used in a wide variety of development tasks.</p>

<h1 id="where-can-i-learn-golang%3F">Where Can I Learn Golang?</h1>

<p>There are a number of resources to start to learn Go:</p>

<h6>Youtube</h6>

<p>I will always search Youtube, but who doesn't right? I found the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp.org</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ">youtube channel</a> to be a really good starting point. I had found a <a href="https://youtu.be/YS4e4q9oBaU">7 hour Golang video</a> created by Michael Van Sickle. For a Go beginner, I found this very informative, starting from the basic syntax and how to set your local environment up.</p>

<p>Please note, as of this videos creation the version of Go is at 1.14 , there is a newer version of Go which is 1.16 to download [follow](https://golang.org/dl/) and pick your OS</p>

<p>
    Since Go 1.16 is released (February 2021), we can start to use go.mod, which allow is Go's dependency management. An following a project setup in the video, we do not have to use all the directories. I would advise to look at the following article on golang.org on how to [organise your code](https://golang.org/doc/code#Organization)
</p>

<h6>Go Documentation</h6>

<p>
    The [Golang.org](https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/getting-started) is another nice place to get started, where it takes you on a step by step through the Go language. If you want to pick up some extra reading on a particular section. 
</p>

<h1 id="how-can-i-practice-go%3F">How can I practice Go?</h1>

<h6>Go Playground</h6>

<p>
    [The Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/) has an in browser terminal which allows you to play with Go by writting the code and pressing run. It temporarely compiles and runs your code in the browser for instant feedback.
