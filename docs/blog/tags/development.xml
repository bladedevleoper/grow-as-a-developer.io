<p>So I have been meaning to write a blog for sometime, and I have been programming with PHP, Javascript coming up to 2 years. So I've been looking at learning a new language, and always wondered what it would be like to learn Go.</p>

<p><img src="https://bladedevleoper.github.io/grow-as-a-developer.io/assets/images/go-gopher.jpg" style="border: solid 1px black" height="239" width="580" title="Go gopher" alt="image of the Go Gopher"></p>

<h1 id="what-is-go%3F">What Is Go?</h1>

<p>Go or as others would say Golang, is a an open source programming language that allows to build reliable and efficient software. Go was created by a team of developers at Google. They are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griesemer">Robert Griesemer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike">Rob Pike</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>. Go is a staticically and a strongly typed language</p>

<h1 id="what-can-go-be-used-for%3F">What can Go be used for?</h1>

<p>Go can be used in many different ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Build Web Applications
    </li>
    <li>
        CLI Applications
    </li>
    <li>
        Automate tasks on the server
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Like Python and PHP, Go too is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language">general purpose language</a> which means it can be used in a wide variety of development tasks.</p>

<h1 id="the-syntax-of-go">The Syntax of Go</h1>

<p>The Go syntax is very similar to Java or Javascript, with the dot notation. At the end of a line, we normally add a semi colon to mark an end of that line (preference in Javascript). In Go a line separator indincates the end of the statement.</p>

<p>Now for those who come from a Java background, will notice the use of the function main. The main function acts as the entry point for our application, be it a cli or a web based application. In the main function we have the the following <code>fmt.Println("hello world")</code> fmt is a package which is apart of the Go language, fmt is Go's string formatting package, which allows us to print text out.</p>

<p>The keyword <code>package</code> is Go's namespace convention, which is the same concept as Java.</p>

<pre>
    package main

    import {
        "fmt"
    }

    //main entry point of the application
    func main () {
        fmt.Println("hello world")
    }
</pre>

<h1 id="where-can-i-learn-go%3F">Where Can I Learn Go?</h1>

<p>There are a number of resources to start learning Go:</p>

<h4>Youtube</h4>

<p>I will always search Youtube, but who doesn't right? I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ">freecodecamp.org youtube channel</a> to be a really good starting point. They had a <a href="https://youtu.be/YS4e4q9oBaU">7 hour Go video</a> created by Michael Van Sickle. For a Go beginner, I found this very informative, starting from the basic syntax and setting up your local environment.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong>, the Go version in the youtube video is version 1.14 , there is a newer version of Go which is 1.16 to download <a href="https://golang.org/dl/">follow</a> and pick your OS.</p>

<p>Since Go version 1.16 release (February 2021), we can start to use go.mod, which is Go's dependency management. An following a project setup in the video, we do not require to use all the directories. I would advise to look at the following article on golang.org on how to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/code#Organization">organise your code</a></p>

<h4>Go Documentation</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/getting-started">Golang.org</a> is another resource to get started, where it takes you on a step by step through the Go language. If you want to pick up some extra reading on a particular section. They have structured the documents for the Go language very well.</p>

<h1 id="how-can-i-practice-go%3F">How can I practice Go?</h1>

<h4>Go Playground</h4>

<p><a href="https://play.golang.org/">The Go Playground</a> has an in browser terminal which allows you to play with Go by writting the code and pressing run. It temporarely compiles and runs your code in the browser for instant feedback.</p>
